- readline input which spans multiple lines could be only partially
  erased correctly before being re-echoed by remote shell, leading to
  duplicate text.

- should ignore signals; currently ctrl-c and friends can kill sshlm
  which we don't want. See also controlling tty and session leaders.

- make a Debian package on "make deb"
  (and run lintian on it)

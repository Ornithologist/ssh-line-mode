- readline input which spans multiple lines could be only partially
  erased correctly before being re-echoed by remote shell, leading to
  duplicate text.

- make a Debian package on "make deb"
  (and run lintian on it)

- readline *really* wants its prompt to start at the beginning of the line.
  if it doesn't, sometimes it will move it there overwriting remote prompt
  etc. So we should probably make it work that way, and the use readline
  functions to erase local echo.

To use, you simply replace "ssh" command with "sshlm".
It passes all its parameters to ssh unmodified.

By default, sshlm starts in char-by-char mode so everything is the same as
when using regular ssh. However, when you press "ctrl-]" hotkey, local line
editing mode pops up (indicated by underlined "L"), where you can use all
GNU Readline functionality (command recall, command line editing etc).

BUGS:

- <tab> key will not do what you want (it will do LOCAL filename completition
  instead). This is hard to fix properly, perhaps we can just make <tab> finish 
  the local line editing and fallback to char-by-char mode.

- FIXME - implement prompt auto-detection to enter line mode automatically,
  so hotkey need not be pressed every time
